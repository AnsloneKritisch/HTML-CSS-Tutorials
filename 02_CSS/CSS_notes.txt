CSS SYNTAX :-

Selector{Property:Value;}

Example :
p { color : blue ; }


THREE WAYS TO ADD CSS TO THE MARKUP :-

1) Inline CSS: CSS is added to the elements directly using style attribute
2) Internal CSS: CSS is kept inside the head tags in <style> tags
3) External CSS: CSS is kept separately inside a .css style sheet

Strongest Command CSS :-

Among all the Command the CSS Command written at first would get more precedence .

For Example :-

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Intro to CSS</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="01_intro.css">
    <style>
        p{ 
            color: whitesmoke ;
            background-color: black;
        }
    </style>

# Here the External CSS is getting more prefernce than Internal CSS because it is written at first .

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Intro to CSS</title>
    <style>
        p{ 
            color: whitesmoke ;
            background-color: black;
        }
    </style>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="01_intro.css">

# Here the Internal CSS is getting more prefernce than External CSS because it is written at first .
